discover_festivals_task:
  description: >
    Research and discover Asian music festivals that feature indie, alternative,
    or independent music. We are looking for recurring festivals to attend in
    {target_year} — so search for recent editions (2024, 2025, 2026) since many
    {target_year} editions won't be announced yet. A festival that ran in 2025
    will almost certainly run again in {target_year}.

    Be broad and inclusive. Small, niche, boutique, and emerging festivals are
    especially welcome. More candidates is always better at this stage.

    STEP 1 - Run ALL of these Firecrawl web searches:
    1.  "music festivals Japan 2025 2026"
    2.  "indie alternative music festivals Japan"
    3.  "boutique independent music festival Japan"
    4.  "music festivals South Korea 2025 2026"

    STEP 2 - Scrape ALL of these pages in full — they are curated lists of
    exactly the festivals we want:

    STEP 3 - For every festival found, collect: official name, country,
    location/venue, dates or "TBA / recurring", website URL, genre description,
    known or past acts, brief description. Note if it is a recurring annual festival.
    Also note any information about open submissions, booking applications, or
    how emerging/unknown artists can apply to perform — this is very valuable.

    Target 60-120 candidates. Do NOT pre-filter — include everything.

  expected_output: >
    A numbered list of 60-120 Asian music festivals (recent or recurring editions),
    each entry containing:
    - Name: [Festival Name]
    - Country: [Country]
    - Location: [City/Venue]
    - Dates: [Specific dates, season, or "Annual / TBA for {target_year}"]
    - Website: [URL]
    - Description: [Brief description of the festival]
    - Genres: [Music genres featured]
    - Known Acts: [Artists confirmed or historically featured, or "Unknown"]
    - Submission Info: [Open call details, application info, deadline, or "Unknown"]

    Include every candidate found regardless of genre. More is better.

score_and_filter_festivals_task:
  description: >
    Review the festival list from the researcher and score each festival's
    alignment with indie-pop and related alternative music genres.

    This list is specifically for an UP-AND-COMING ARTIST seeking performance
    opportunities. Smaller, boutique, and emerging festivals are MORE valuable
    than massive ones — they are more likely to book unknown acts.

    Be GENEROUS — when in doubt, include rather than exclude.
    Small, niche, and lesser-known festivals are exactly what we want.

    SCORING CRITERIA:

    HIGH (strong indie alignment — definitely include):
    - Core identity is indie, alternative, or independent music
    - Has booked or historically featured indie/alt artists like: Mitski, Arlo Parks,
      Japanese Breakfast, Khruangbin, The xx, Beach House, Tame Impala, Mac DeMarco,
      Cigarettes After Sex, Rex Orange County, CHAI, go!go!vanillas, Phum Viphurit,
      Hyukoh, No Party For Cao Dong, Sunset Rollercoaster, Grapevine, Indigo la End,
      Tempalay, Yogee New Waves, or any similar indie/dream pop/shoegaze/synth-pop artist
    - Boutique, DIY, or independent festival ethos
    - Strong indie-folk, dream pop, shoegaze, synth-pop, chillwave, K-indie,
      J-indie, bedroom pop, or indie rock presence
    - Festivals known for featuring or breaking emerging/new artists
    - Festivals with open submissions or an application process for unknown artists

    MEDIUM (partial or possible indie alignment — include these):
    - Mixed programming that includes any indie or alternative acts
    - General rock festivals (likely to have indie acts on bill)
    - Multi-genre festivals with diverse lineups
    - Festivals with limited English info — give benefit of the doubt
    - Electronic music that is not pure mainstream EDM
    - Any festival where genre is unclear but it sounds independent or non-mainstream
    - Festivals in India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China where indie
      scenes are growing — default to Medium if uncertain

    LOW (exclude ONLY if clearly irrelevant):
    - Explicitly pure K-pop idol showcases with zero other genres
    - Explicitly pure mainstream EDM/rave events
    - Explicitly pure heavy metal with no other genres
    - Classical or jazz only

    IMPORTANT: If you are unsure, score it MEDIUM and include it. The user
    will review manually. Never exclude a festival just because you lack info.
    Boutique and emerging festivals score HIGHER, not lower.

    Target output: 30-60 festivals (aim for the higher end).

  expected_output: >
    A structured list of 30-60 festivals with High or Medium genre fit scores.
    Format each entry as:

    - Name: [Festival Name]
    - Country: [Country]
    - Location: [City/Venue]
    - Dates: [Dates, season, or "Annual / TBA for {target_year}"]
    - Website: [URL]
    - Description: [Brief description]
    - Genres: [Music genres featured]
    - Genre Fit Score: [High | Medium]
    - Why It Fits: [1-2 sentences. If uncertain, say so and still include it.]
    - Known Acts: [Artists or "Unknown"]
    - Submission Info: [Open call details, application info, or "Unknown"]

    Aim for the higher end of the range. Include all borderline cases.
