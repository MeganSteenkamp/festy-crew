discover_festivals_task:
  description: >
    Research and discover Asian music festivals that feature indie, alternative,
    or independent music. We are looking for recurring festivals to attend in
    {target_year} — so search for recent editions (2024, 2025, 2026) since many
    {target_year} editions won't be announced yet. A festival that ran in 2025
    will almost certainly run again in {target_year}.

    Be broad and inclusive. Small, niche, boutique, and emerging festivals are
    especially welcome. More candidates is always better at this stage.

    STEP 1 - Run ALL of these Firecrawl web searches:
    1. "best indie music festivals Asia 2026"
    2. "best indie music festivals Asia 2025"
    3. "alternative music festivals Japan 2026"
    4. "K-indie festival Korea 2026"
    5. "Korean indie rock music festival Seoul Busan Daegu"
    6. "indie pop music festival Thailand 2026"
    7. "indie music festival Philippines 2026"
    8. "indie music festival Taiwan 2026"
    9. "indie music festival Indonesia Singapore 2026"
    10. "J-indie music festival Japan 2025 2026"
    11. "Fuji Rock Summer Sonic Spring Sensation Japan lineup"
    12. "indie alternative festival Asia annual recurring"
    13. "boutique music festival Asia indie underground"
    14. "music festival Asia indie pop dream pop shoegaze 2025 2026"

    STEP 2 - Scrape ALL of these pages in full — they are curated lists of
    exactly the festivals we want:

    STEP 3 - For every festival found, collect: official name, country,
    location/venue, dates or "TBA / recurring", website URL, genre description,
    known or past acts, brief description. Note if it is a recurring annual festival.

    Target 40-100 candidates. Do NOT pre-filter — include everything.

  expected_output: >
    A numbered list of 40-100 Asian music festivals (recent or recurring editions),
    each entry containing:
    - Name: [Festival Name]
    - Country: [Country]
    - Location: [City/Venue]
    - Dates: [Specific dates, season, or "Annual / TBA for {target_year}"]
    - Website: [URL]
    - Description: [Brief description of the festival]
    - Genres: [Music genres featured]
    - Known Acts: [Artists confirmed or historically featured, or "Unknown"]

    Include every candidate found regardless of genre. More is better.

score_and_filter_festivals_task:
  description: >
    Review the festival list from the researcher and score each festival's
    alignment with indie-pop and related alternative music genres.

    Be GENEROUS — when in doubt, include rather than exclude.
    Small, niche, and lesser-known festivals are exactly what we want.

    SCORING CRITERIA:

    HIGH (strong indie alignment — definitely include):
    - Core identity is indie, alternative, or independent music
    - Has booked or historically featured artists like: Mitski, Arlo Parks,
      Japanese Breakfast, Khruangbin, The xx, Beach House, Tame Impala, CHAI,
      go!go!vanillas, Phum Viphurit, Hyukoh, No Party For Cao Dong, Sunset Rollercoaster,
      Grapevine, Indigo la End, YEW, Peder Elias, YENTED & MRCH, Øneheart & Flawed Mangoes, Patrick Brasca, elijah woods, 
      Keenan Te, The Ge, Jess Benko, tiffi & Dress, Ukiyo, Slowboy & Eluera, or similar indie/alt acts
    - Boutique, DIY, or independent festival ethos
    - Strong indie-folk, dream pop, shoegaze, synth-pop, chillwave, K-indie,
      J-indie, or indie rock presence

    MEDIUM (partial or possible indie alignment — include these):
    - Mixed programming that includes any indie or alternative acts
    - General rock festivals (likely to have indie acts on bill)
    - Multi-genre festivals with diverse lineups
    - Festivals with limited English info — give benefit of the doubt
    - Electronic music that is not pure mainstream EDM
    - Any festival where genre is unclear but it sounds independent or non-mainstream

    LOW (exclude ONLY if clearly irrelevant):
    - Explicitly pure K-pop idol showcases with zero other genres
    - Explicitly pure mainstream EDM/rave events
    - Explicitly pure heavy metal with no other genres
    - Classical or jazz only

    IMPORTANT: If you are unsure, score it MEDIUM and include it. The user
    will review manually. Never exclude a festival just because you lack info.

    Target output: 20-50 festivals (aim for the higher end).

  expected_output: >
    A structured list of 20-50 festivals with High or Medium genre fit scores.
    Format each entry as:

    - Name: [Festival Name]
    - Country: [Country]
    - Location: [City/Venue]
    - Dates: [Dates, season, or "Annual / TBA for {target_year}"]
    - Website: [URL]
    - Description: [Brief description]
    - Genres: [Music genres featured]
    - Genre Fit Score: [High | Medium]
    - Why It Fits: [1-2 sentences. If uncertain, say so and still include it.]
    - Known Acts: [Artists or "Unknown"]

    Aim for the higher end of the range. Include all borderline cases.
